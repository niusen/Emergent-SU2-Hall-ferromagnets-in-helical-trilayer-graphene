To use the julia codes, one need to set correct sublattice potential "AB_potential", twist angle "theta_", dielectric constant "epsilon", corrugation "waa", and finite clusters geometries defined by (V1,V2) in the table S1 of the Supplemental Materials. 

"Helical_Trilayer_ED.jl" calculates the many-body energy spectrum;
"Helical_Trilayer_PairCorrel_Sq.jl" calculates the structure factor and pair correlation functions;
"Helical_Trilayer_Chern.jl" calculates the many-body Chern number;
"Helical_Trilayer_PES.jl" calculates the particle-cut entanglement spectrum for FCI phase;
"Helical_Trilayer_correlation_matrix.jl" calculates the momentum space correlation matrix used for extracting the emergent pseudospins and SU(2) quantum numbers.
